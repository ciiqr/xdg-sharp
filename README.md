# xdg-sharp
A rather crude port of pyxdg to C#

## Done (though needs more testing overall)
* BaseDirectory  
* DesktopEntry  
* IniFile  
* Config  

## Todo
* Locale  
* RecentFiles  
* IconTheme  
* Mime  
* MenuEditor  
* Menu  
* Add a proper testing framework  
* Update any specifications which are out of date  
* Ensure the method/property names match C#'s style
